whiteboard.

This is a QT-based whiteboard software. Since the whiteboard is needed for other projects, it has been separated into its own project. This project will continue to be maintained in the future.

Plans:
Set the brush thickness and canvas color.
Allow modification of the canvas background for use with screenshot software.
Package it as a library for easy integration into other projects.

Brief introduction:

	1.Double-clicking on drawn text allows it to enter edit mode again for adjustments.
	2.When the mouse changes to a hand icon, you can select shapes, drag them to change their position, and also delete them using a button.
